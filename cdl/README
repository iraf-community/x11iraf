	This directory contains the Client Display Library (CDL) sources.
The CDL is a  host interface for C or Fortran programs allowing them to
display images or overlay graphics to display servers such as XImtool or
SAOimage / SAOtng.  High-level procedures allow IRAF or FITS images to be
displayed simply, other routines permit access to all other server functions
(e.g. cursor and image readback, frame selection, etc).  The library also
features a number of functions for doing image overlay graphics; supported
graphics primitives include numerous point shapes, lines, circles, ellipses,
polygons, annular shapes, and text.

    This package is made up of several interfaces, specifically

	CDL	- high-level image display and graphics overlay
	IMD	- mid-level image display routines
	COMM	- server communications (currently IIS)

See the Notes file or Reference Guide in the doc subdirectory for more
information.

	Source for the library itself is in this directory.  Documentation
is in the 'doc' subdirectory and demonstration applications can be found in
the 'examples' subdirectory.  The 'test' subdirectory contains debugging
programs used during development; they're not really good examples of
programming practice but may serve as demos of how individual functions
can be called.

	See the RELEASE.NOTES file in this directory, or the Reference
Guide in the 'doc' subdirectory for information on using and installing
this library.
