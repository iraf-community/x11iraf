CDL PACKAGE EXAMPLES --  This directory contains several example programs
to demostrate usage of the Client Display library.  Programs are available
in both C and Fortran.  These are working examples but perhaps not the most
highly efficient code since they're meant to demonstrate how the package
might be used.  Tasks available so far include

	DISPLAY.C	- C program to display an image.  Demonstrates how
			  to use the high level format display calls, the
			  midlevel raw pixel display, and the lowest level
			  raw raster display methods.
	TVMARK.C	- C program to display and image and overlay with
			  point marks, optional interactive marking available.
			  Demonstrates usage of cursor reads and call for
	 		  the various marking routines.
	MOSAIC.C	- C program to mosaic several images on the display.
			  Demonstrates the use of low-level raster I/O to
			  do more complex display operations.

	FDISPLAY.F	- Fortran equivalent of the DISPLAY task above.
	FTVMARK.F	- Fortran equivalent of the TVMARK task above.

Misc Files in This Directory:

	DPIX.FITS	- 512x512 test image of M51
	COORDS		- sample coordinate file for tvmark task
