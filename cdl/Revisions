=============
V1.7 Released
=============

cdl.c				**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
	Modified the behavior of cdl_getFrame() to do a sampling cursor
	read to get the frame buffer from the server.  If the value returned
	is zero (as from SAOimage) the current value of the frame number in
	the CDL is returned.  (3/29/00)

cdl.[ch]			**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
imd.c				**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
comm.c				**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdlProto.h			**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdl_f77.[ch]			**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdl_spp.c			**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
examples/tvmark.c		**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
test/cdltest.c			**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
test/imdtest.c			**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
	Modified the cdl_readCursor() routine to have a new 'wcs' argument
	to return the WCS of the cursor read.  This is to allow applications
	to get the frame number of the read from the wcs (i.e. wcs is
	coded as "frame * 100 + wcs".   (3/29/00)

imd.c
	Fixed a bug in the drawing of markers where the start coord for
	the subraster is (1,1).  When writing out the subraster the
	routine was incorrectly deciding that the frame buffer did not
	need to be readback to edit the subraster.  (3/14/00)

examples/mosaic.c
	Added an ability to display raw images of the same size per user
	request (2/19/99)

cdl.c
cdlmark.c
	Removed duplicate <stdlib.h> includes (1/5/99)

comm.c
	Fixed a readWCS call so it correctly gets the frame requested,
	now it's always getting frame 1. (1/4/99)

imd.c
	Closed the file descriptors in imd_close().  This was preventing
	the CDL from reconnecting properly and leaving the server in a 
	read hang.  (1/4/99)

cdl_f77.c
	Modified the CDF_READ* wrappers to use a temporary buffer in the
	actual call to the CDL C routines since fortran passes in static
	arrays which cannot be reallocated by the low-level C code.  The
	data is moved from the temp buffer to the input buffer after the
	call. (1/2/99)

cdl_f77.[ch]
cdl_spp.[ch]
	Fixed some errors in the binding code not finding certain procedures.
	(10/28/98)

cdlfits.c
	Changed bscale/bzero to double to avoid an overflow (10/13/98)

cdlmark.c
	Added an offset to the circle coordinate calculation to assure
	circle is centered. (10/13/98)

cdl.c
	Fixed a bug in the zscale of real and double data.  (6/3/98)

cdlzscale.c
	Fixed a bug in floatCompare causing the sort to fail when the range
	of data is <1.0  (6/2/98)

imd.c
	Modified debug output so individual writes are only printed when
	verbose output requested.  (6/1/98)

cdl.c
cdl.h
	Modified the zscale code to behave more like the V2.11 code in
	determining z1/z2.  If the number of sample lines isn't explicitly
	set then the sample is derived evenly from the entire image as though
	with an image section, otherwise the old method is used.  The default
	number of sample points was increased to 1000.  (6/1/98)

imd.c
	Fixed a bug in the image display code causing garbage values
	for some image sizes (3/16/98)

cdlfits.c
	Removed col 30 restriction from logical keywords  (3/16/98)

All sources
	Numerous changes to all sources to provide ANSI C function prototypes
	and to separate the public and private declarations.  For ANSI use
	CDL_ANSIC must be defined prior to the "#include <cdl.h>". (1/16/98)

cdl_f77.[ch]
cdl_spp.[ch]
cdlspp.h
cdlftn.inc
cdlmark.c
cdl.h

	hooked them into marker code.  Also added a new BOLD font type
	which maintain current font but increases the width. (1/5/98)

imd.c
	Fixed a bug in computing the WCS for images larger than the FB (1/1/98)
	
imd.c
	Changed the subraster code so it would do a read when writing as
	subraster the full width of the FB. (1/1/98)

cdliraf.c			**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdlfits.c			**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdl_f77.c 			**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdl_spp.c			**** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
	Changed the cdl_readXXX() calls to return the title string (1/1/98)

cdlfits.c
examples/display.c
	Fixed a bug in writing the name/title to the WCS (12/31/97)

cdl.h
cdl.c
imd.c
	Fixed a bug where the z1/z2 values weren't being properly loaded by
	the cdl_displayPix procedure when zscaling. (12/29/97)

cdl.h
imd.h
	Included cdl.h in the imd.h file so there is only one structure
	definition of the IMD struct.  Cleaned up duplicate defines. (11/13/97)

cdlmark.c
cdlfont.h
cdl_f77.[ch]
cdl_spp.[ch]
	Added a new routine cdl_setFont() which can be used to choose be-
	tween a set of new fonts. (9/9/97)

cdliraf.c
	Modified to handle new V2 OIF format images. (6/6/97)

cdlmark.c
	Fixed up the text presentation a bit by making the default size
	a little larger for clarity, added proportional spacing for thin
	chars like 'i' and 'l', and fixed a bug in the subregion size (6/4/97)

configure			+
Makefile.generic		+
examples/ Makefile.generic	+
test/ Makefile.generic		+
	Added a generalized set of makefiles for sites w/out Imake (4/27/97)

eps.c
	Fixed a minor bug in axis labeling.  (4/27/97)

cdliraf.c
cdlfits.c
	Initialized z1/z2 values in display procedures (4/25/97)

cdl.c
cdlmark.c
	The DLHead/DLtail structures were being accessed as one-indexed
	arrays, changed so they're zero-index and won't overflow the
	allocation. (4/25/97)

comm.c
	Fixed a bug where the fbconfig was being passed in incorrectly in
	a clear-frame request.  Caused a "shifted buffer" effect on SAOimage
	in subsequent calls to the display example. (4/24/97)

comm.c
doc/cdlref.ms
doc/cdlref.ps
	Fixed a bug in the encoding of the frame number as it's passed to
	the server, caused display to frames 3-4 to fail. Updated docs.
	(4/22/97)

cdl.c
	Removed the imd_setWCS() call from the cdl_open() procedure to
	avoid reinitialize the frame buffers in the server.  This would
	erase previously displayed frames  e.g. in the display example
	when using an FB larger than the default.  (4/13/97)

cdl.c
cdl_f.c
doc/cdlref.ms
doc/cdlref.ps
	Changed the behavior of the cdl_open() procedure (C and F77) to check
	automatically for the IMTDEV variable if passed a NULL arg.  Also
	fixed a bug in the fortran interface string stripping procedure intro-
	duced by the earlier bug fix.  (3/29/97)

cdl_f.c
	Fixed bug in string passing.  Fortran appends a 'hidden' string
	length argument that was not being used and strings were being
	truncated or assumed to be a certain length improperly.  Also
	modified CDF_OPEN to handle an empty string properly (the ftn
	getenv procedure doesn't always return a NULL, just an empty
	string). (3/27/97)

examples/fdisplay.f
examples/ftvmark.f
	Modified to show use of IMTDEV environment variable for making
	the server connection. (3/27/97)

eps.c
	Added a grestore to the prolog to workaround a bug on Digital
	Printerserver 17 printers.  (3/27/97)

cdlfits.c
	Fixed a bug in the reading of FITS files with BSCALE/BZERO (3/18/97)

cdl_f.c
	Removed an errant cdl arg to CDF_CLOSE (3/12/97)

imd.c
eps.c
cdl.h
comm.c
test/imdtest.c
	Ifdef'd uchar typedef for AIX systems. (3/12/97)

cdliraf.c
examples/display.c
	Ifdef'd <sys/types.h> include for lseek on Ultrix systems (3/12/97)

cdliraf
comm.c
	SAOimage assumes that a ClearFrame request passes the fbconfig
	number in the tid field of the packet, XImtool doesn't.  This
	is also what IRAF does so the FEEDBACK unit now also passes in
	the fbconfig as well.  (2/28/97)

cdl.c
comm.c
	Added debugging output to print each header packet for comm 
	interface. (2/28/97)

cdliraf.c
	Fixed one bug causing a segvio for odd sized images, fixed another
	affecting image with padding in the pixels. (2/27/97)

examples/display.c
	Enabled -fbconfig flag for iraf format (2/27/97)

cdl.c
	Changed a debug print so 'imtdev' isn't printed directly if it's
	NULL, causes a segvio on Sol2.5 systems.  (2/27/97)

examples/Imakefile
	Needed to add "-lnsl -lsocket" for Solaris linking. (2/27/97)

Imakefile
	Added a "HasSunC" check for Solaris check since the extra flags are
	only needed by SunPRO compilers, not GCC.  (2/26/97)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
V1.0 Beta released.  (2/26/97)
