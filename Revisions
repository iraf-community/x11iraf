#
# See also the x11iraf$obm/OBM.revs file for a detailed list of changes to OBM.
#
# Begun 6 Mar 1997
# -----------------------

X11IRAF.tmpl
	Removed a /* from the comment causing aix to complain

ximtool/Imakefile
	Removed the !@#^% app-defaults install
	Change man page install, wasn't working on Solaris

ximtool/load.c
	Removed a qsort call and replaced with a local string sort, avoids
	crashes on various platforms

ximtool/ximtool.c
	Fixed -memModel and -fifo_flag bugs

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Minor mod to workaround Layout crash on alpha.  Also changed "Close"
	buttons to be "Done" so all subpanels are consistent.

ximtool/save.c
	Added a missing arg to sprintf causing a segvio.

obm/widget.c
	Changed encoding of obm pointer address for do_text to %lx since
	pointers on the alpha overflowed the %x and the pointer was lost.

ximtool/ximtool.c
	Fixed a bug w/ the -fifo flag

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Defined width for TextButton widgets to workaround bug on Xterminals.

ximtool/eps.c
	Fixed a missing grestore causing problems for Digital PrintServer 17
	printers.

ximtool/ximtool.c
ximtool/ximtool.man
ximtool/ximtool.html
ximtool/ximtool.ps
	Fixed a bug preventing the resource command line args from actually
	taking effect.  Also clarified the explanation of the ximprint.cfg
	file, regenerated postscript man page.

xtapemon/xtapemon.man
xtapemon/xtapemon.ps
	Following a user suggestion moved the discussion of the amount of
	tape used being acurately calculated from the BUGS section to the 
	DISCUSSION section since it will usually be the case that the count
	will be incorrect unless MTEXAMINE is used to position the tape, this
	wasn't as obvious before.  Regenerated postscript man page.

obm/ObmW/LayoutP.h
xaw3d/LayoutP.h
	Changed the XtMalloc call for creating new objects to XtCalloc calls
	so values are properly initialized. Fixes OSF V3.2d1 bug.

ximtool/fitsio.c
	Ifndef AIXV3 for typedef uchar 'cuz it was conflicting

---------------------------
V1.0 Patch-1 release 4/5/97
---------------------------

xgterm/main.c
	Undef'd memove for SunOS and X11R6 systems

ximtool/load.c
	For large directories the message containing the directory listing
	was overflowing the xim_message static buffer, modified to call
	OBM directly. 

ximtool/ximclient.c
	Fixed a typo in the page size setting page orientation.

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Added "send <widget> activate" msgs to the main display and colorbar
	widgets so the saved cursor position is intialized in the widget.  If
	this is not done a WCSLAB will sample the cursor before beginning the
	display causing the widget to restore unitialized positions which can
	blow away the app with a server error.

ximtool/iis.c
	Added IIS packet debugging output triggered by a DEBUG_IIS env var.

ximtool/iis.c
	Removed some code related to setting the fbconfig in the special
	case of fbconfig=1 and the window not the same size as the frame
	buffer.  This was apparently done originally when experimenting with
	resizing the window automatically but that was abandoned and this		code was never removed.  It causes a bug in displaying to an un-
	initialized frame.

ximtool/ximtool.h
	Changed FBCONFIG_ENV2 from 'XIMTOOLRC' to 'IMTOOLRC' (6/1)

ximtool/irafio.c
	Modified to handle new OIF V2 images. (6/8)

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/newimtool.gui
	Deleted windowRGB translations. (6/11)

ximtool/iis.c
	Fixed a missing pair of braces. (7/9)

ximtool/ximtool.c
	Fixed a bug in the -nframes flag (7/9)

obm/ObmW/Gterm.c
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Implemented magnify marker and cursor movement keystrokes for alt gui.
	Fixed bug in scaling raster zero cursor values causing keystroke
	moves to 'jump', change in get_draw_context() (7/11)

ximtool/eps.c
ximtool/eps.h
ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Fixed BoundingBox errors and unmatched grestore preventing inclusion
	of images in AASTex docs (8/6)

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Added Shift-MB2Up translation to turn off crosshair when button 
	released. (8/6)

ximtool/ximtool.c
	Added "-rv" toolkit flag. (8/22)

ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Fixed size of magnifier marker, added some common keystroke trans-
	lations to markers. (8/22)

Imakefile
vximtool/		+
	Added the Virtual XImtool dummy server (8/22)

obm/ObmW/Gterm.c
	Fixed a bug in GtSetMapping which wasn't returning a success value,
	caused an evaluation error on HP  (8/26)

obm/ObmW/Gterm.c
	Fixed a bug in refresh_destination() in which only the left side of
	an image would be displayed if the FB was bigger than 512x512 and
	memModel=beNiceToServer.  (8/27)

obm/ObmW/Gterm.c
	Fixed a bug in scale_intzoom in which a beNiceToServer memModel would
	display odd zooms factors w/ a yflip. (8/27)

ximtool/ximtool.man
ximtool/ximtool.html
	Misc. typos.  (8/28)

Imakefile
ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool.html
	Changed version to V1.1 set release date as 9/1/97?  (8/28)

ximtool/Imakefile
	Modified to automatically build a separate ximtool-alt binary.
	Eventually one or the other GUI should be used as the default so
	for now there are copies of the needed files and each binary builds
	from a different list, but the directory should be cleaned up when
	the new features are added permanently (8/28)

obmsh/Imakefile
obmsh/obmsh.man		+
	Added a man page for the task (8/28)

ximtool/raster.c
	Fixed an off-by-one bug in the computation of the center when doing
	an integer zoom.  Caused a one pixel boundary on two sides of a
	hardcopy plot (8/29)

ximtool/ximtool-alt.man
ximtool/ximtool-alt.html
	Added documentation for the alt GUI. (8/29)

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool.html
	Removed cursor movement commands (9/10)

obm/Tcl/Imakefile
	DU4 now defines OSF1Architecture instead of OSF1, wasn't getting
	the right flags. (9/10)

obm/Imakefile
obm/ObmP.h
ximtool/Imakefile
ximtool/eps.c
ximtool/fitsio.c
ximtool/gifio.c
ximtool/irafio.c
	Digital Unix 4 now defines a uchar typedef so had I had to define
	an OSF1 flag to workaround the local typedefs causing compiler errors.
	(9/10)

xpm/Imakefile
xaw3d/Imakefile
	Needed to add a 'all' target specifying the library to be built.
	On AIX these Imakefiles create an enpty all target and the library
	is skipped since it thinks the (empty) target is up to date. (9/10)

vximtool/vximtool.c
	Need to ifdef include <sys/select.h> for AIX (9/10)

--------------------
V1.1 Release  (9/10)
--------------------

ximtool/eps.c
	Fixed the gsave/grestore pairing again.  Somehow the change got
	lost and had to be redone, this slipped by earlier testing for
	the V2.1 release.  (11/3)

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
ximtool/ximtool-mag.gui
	Change the winWidth/winHeight initialization to query the imagewin
	rather than use a fixed 512 size.  This is required to properly scale
	the image when the window size was set with a geometry flag/resource
	(11/20)

vximtool/vximtool.c
	Changed so that when the stdin is added to the select list only when
	-i is not set explicitly, or when -background is used explicitly.

ximtool/ximtool-alt
ximtool/ximtool-mag
	Moved the #!/bin/csh to line 1 so scripts may be executed from
	Bourne shells  (3/15/98)

ximtool/print.c
ximtool/save.c
ximtool/irafio.c
	Fixed complaints about incompatible pointer types from GCC (3/31/98)

ximtool/ximtool.c
	Added error handling code to dump core after 5 errors received if
	XGXERROR set to 'dumpcore', or exit on 'exit'.  (4/2/98)

xaw3d   --> xaw3d-old
xaw3d/Scrollbar*.[ch]
xaw3d/ThreeD*.[ch]
	Replaced Scrollbar widget with one from the Xaw3d V1.3 library which
	gives a true 3D Motif-like scrollbar with arrows.

xgterm  --> xgterm-old
xgterm/   (all sources)
	1) Diff-merged to bring XGterm up to X11R6 version
	2) Numerous bug fixes to the dynamic colors code so it can properly
	   be enabled/disabled via +/-dc flags or dynamicColors resource.
	3) Made the right-side scrollbar a runtime +/-sbr option or
	   scrollBarRight resource
	4) Merged new 3D scrollbar and color resources into app-defaults file

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
ximtool/ximtool-mag.gui
	Added new Scrollbar resources for the help and info panels to get
	the 3-D effect. (4/28/98)

ximtool/load.c
	Fixed a bug in which loading e.g. frame 2 with certain frame buffers
	would cause the image load to fail.  The imtoolrc file for some FBs
	only define one frame by default, the code was not initializing any
	more that specified even if it was load some other frame (5/7/98)

ximtool/iis.c
	Fixed a bug in which turning off the DISPLAY 'select' param could
	erase frame 1.  (5/16/98)

ximtool/zscale.c
	Changed the comparison function for qsort to handle cases where the
	range of data is <1.0 (6/1/98)

obm/server.c
	Fixed a bug affecting the use of "-display" when DISPLAY wasn't also
	set in the environment.  The call to XtOpenDisplay at line 385 was
	passing '""' as a argument for the display name instead of NULL and
        so the routine wasn't parsing for the argument internally, and if
	DISPLAY wasn't set in the environment as a backup this would result
	in a NULL Display pointer being returned which would segvio on the
        next line.  Added an error check for a NULL return from XtOpenDisplay.
	(6/4/98)

ximtool/raster.c
obm/Tcl/tclExpr.c
obm/Tcl/tclParse.c
	Added a redefinition of isalnum() for linux systems to work around
	an incompatibility of the definition of this macro between Slackware
	and RedHat 4.2 systems. (6/4/98)

xgterm/charproc.c
	Increased TEXT_BUF_SIZE from 256 to 1024 to allow longer input lines,
	e.g. when doing a cut-n-paste of compiler verbose output which expands
	path names. (6/17/98)

ximtool/iis.c
	Fixed a bug in which resetting the FB and displaying to frame >1
	would leave the server displaying frame 1.  (6/17/98)

ximtool/ximtool.c
	Fixed a typo in the pointer allocation for a -fifo opt (9/3/98)

ximtool/iis.c
vximtool/vximtool.c
	Changed the read()/write() calls to new routines which loop until
	all of the expected bytes have been read or written.  On inet socket
	connections it's possible that the I/O would return a short count if
	a kernel buffer filled up causing bad reads and eventually a crash.
	This may also explain the occassional "bad header checksum" errors
	that have been reported.  (9/26/98)

xgterm/main.c
	Moved a block of code to get a pty for IRIX 6.5 systems to avoid an
	segvio when out of ptys.  The old code was left where it was for
	earlier versions.  (12/2/98)

ximtool/irafio.c
	There was a duplicate close of the image header which caused a 
	memory corruption on linux systems when loading an image on the
	command line. (2/8/99)

Imakefile
*/Imakefile
mkarch		+
	Added support for  doing multiple architectures. (3/2/99)

xaw3d/AsciiSink.c
	Removed the 'black box' drawn on the right side of the screen
	indicating there is more text off the screen.  (3/30/99)

xgterm/gtermio.c
	Fixed a bug in the arg ordering of the call to GtReadPixels() (4/22/99)

xgterm/gtermio.c
	The colormap readback required that the rgb arrays be right shifted
	8 bit for the value to be interpreted correctly. (4/24/99)

Imakefile
ximtool/*.gui
	Increased version number to V1.2, set expected release date 5/30/99.

ximtool/iis.c
ximtool/raster.c
	Fixed a problem with initialize frames when adding new frames while
	in tile mode.  Previously if there were 2 frames defined and you
	displayed to frame 3 you would be dumped from tile mode silently,
	the new code just changes the number of tile frames.  Also fixed 
	was a bug where displaying to a new fbconfig was not reinitializing
	the tile mode properly (e.g. in a 4-frame tile changing to a 2-frame
	config would leave the task in 4-frame mode and improperly clear
	the screen mapping).  (5/17/99)

xgterm/misc.c
	Modified the xerror() procedure to recognize XGXERROR as 'ignore'
	which will cause the error to be ignored and not counted towards the
	total which eventually causes the task to exit.  Also added an
	XGMAXERROR environment variable which can be defined to set the
	limit.  (8/24/99)

xgterm/gtermio.c
	1) Modified so any buffered output is flushed when activated.  This
	is to keep any GUI client commands that may have been caused by
	pushing buttons while the client program isn't running from being
	read by the next cursor read.  For example after the GUI is done
	it may not be unmapped and a 'Quit' key send a 'q' keystroke.  One
	could hit the button several times causing numerous 'q' commands to
 	be buffered, the next interactive task would get the keystrokes
	and probably quit itself, causing confusion for the user.
	2) Also posted a dummy gio_deactivate_cb() procedure.  This appears
	to be necessary to catch a window-close event such as can be done
	from the window manager menubar or 'X' button.  (8/24/99)

ximtool/raster.c
	Modified the frame buffer config open procedure to set defaults for
	commonly used sizes such as 1K, 2K, etc.  Also modified to search for
	the imtoolrc file in additional directories such as /opt/local/lib,
	/iraf/iraf/dev, and if not found will now print out a warning
	message. (9/8/99)

ximtool/print.c
ximtool/ximtool*.gui
	Made the title/colorbar/borders are optional. (11/9/99)

ximtool/iis.c
	Added a SO_REUSEADDR option to the inet socket (11/99)

ximtool/ximtool*.gui
	Added new keystrke commands Ctrl-<arrow> and Ctrl-Alt-<arrow> to
	move the frame one or a hald panner width in the given direction.
	This is useful for panning full window frames around large mosaic
	images (12/99)

ximtool/save.c
ximtool/tiffio.c	+
ximtool/ximtool*.gui
	Added a TIFF output format option for the save command.  This is a
	very basic TIFF file, input cannot be supported without supporting
	the full tiff library.  (2/00)

xaw3d/Imakefile
xaw3d/Text.c                                                            MF039
xaw3d/TextTr.c
    Modified the code to make _XawDefaultTextTranslations a static array
    rather than one allocated and never freed.   Required changes to the
    array declaration in TextTr.c, and textClassRec definition and 
    ClassInitialize() procedure.  (3/2/00)

cdl/imd.c
        Fixed a bug in the drawing of markers where the start coord for
        the subraster is (1,1).  When writing out the subraster the
        routine was incorrectly deciding that the frame buffer did not
        need to be readback to edit the subraster.  (3/14/00)

ximtool/ximtool.gui
	Deleted a debug print statement (3/15/00)

xaw3d/Label.c
xaw3d/List.c
xaw3d/Panner.c
xaw3d/Scrollbar.c
xaw3d/SmeBSB.c
obm/ObmW/Gcs.c
obm/ObmW/Tabs.c
obm/ObmW/MultiList.c
	Added an #ifdef USE_XMU_STIPPLE around code calling the
	XmuCreateStippledPixemap() routine.  This procedure maintains a cache
	of the pixmaps which would be corrupted at somepoint resulting in
	BadGC and BadPixmap errors, causing xgterm stability problems. (3/28/00)

xaw3d/Paned.c
xaw3d/Simple.c
xaw3d/SimpleMenu.c
obm/ObmW/Frame.c
	Added and #ifdef USW_CWCURSOR around code which adds the CW_Cursor
	XCreateWindow attribute in widget creation.  This was causing various
	BadCursor bugs in the X lib which would cascade and result in xgterm
	stability problems.  (3/28/00)

cdl/cdl.c                           **** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
        Modified the behavior of cdl_getFrame() to do a sampling cursor
        read to get the frame buffer from the server.  If the value returned
        is zero (as from SAOimage) the current value of the frame number in
        the CDL is returned.  (3/29/00)

cdl/cdl.[ch]                        **** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdl/imd.c                           **** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdl/comm.c                          **** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdl/cdl_f77.[ch]                    **** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdl/cdl_spp.c                       **** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdl/examples/tvmark.c               **** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdl/test/cdltest.c                  **** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
cdl/test/imdtest.c                  **** INTERFACE CHANGE ****
        Modified the cdl_readCursor() routine to have a new 'wcs' argument
        to return the WCS of the cursor read.  This is to allow applications
        to get the frame number of the read from the wcs (i.e. wcs is
        coded as "frame * 100 + wcs".   (3/29/00)

xaw3d/Text.h
	Removed include of <X11/Xaw/AsciiSrc.h>.  Comments indicate this is
	only required for R3 compatability but due to changes the the Xaw
	text widget in XFree86 V4 the include file changes were causing
	compile problems.  (4/5/00)

xgterm/screen.c
xgterm/scrollbar.c
	Removed declarations for calloc/malloc/realloc since they were
	conflicting <stdlib.h> and causing build problems on Solaris 8.
	Used explicit cast of pointer when needed in code instead.  (4/5/00)

X11IRAF.tmpl
obm/ObmW/Imakefile
	Modified CCOPTIONS for Solaris 8 and HPUX build of new Tab widgets.
	(4/5/00)

ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-mag.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
	Updated translation tables with Ctrl-M and Ctrl-P keystrokes to
	toggle magnifier/panner markers.  (4/7/00)

xgterm/misc.c
	Changed the default behavior of the xerror() handler to ignore any
	BadCursor events.  A new action value, 'catchall', can be defined
	to bypass this and count all error actions toward the final
	shutdown. (4/7/00)

cdl.h
        Fixed a typo in the prototype declaration for cdl_readCursor (4/14/00)

xgterm/misc.c
	Fixed a bug in the way BadCursor errors were being ignored.  (4/14/00)

xgterm/gtermio.c
	Forgot to merge in a change mapping LFLF to LF the same way CRLF is
	currently mapped.  On Alpha systems there is an apparent bug in the
	stdgraph kernel causing this to extra char to be inserted and
	confusing the interpretation of the GUI message.  Hacked around this
	for now by mapping LFLF to a single LF but it needs to be investigated
	further.  (4/14/00)

X11IRAF.tmpl
	Added a special-case XTOOLONLYLIB flag so binaries built on lyra
	will use the patched Xt library needed to work around the  "Attempt
	to manage a child widget when parent is not Composite" message
	during shutdown.  (4/14/00)
	
cdl/mkpkg		+
	Added a mkpkg file to build the library.  Requested by Ken Mighell
	for use in one of his packages.  (4/17/00)

mkarch
obm/Tcl/tclInt.h
obm/ObmW/HTML-PSformat.c
	Added a workaround for our old use of the varargs macros which was
	causing problems under LinuxPPC.  Also changed arch name from
	mklinux to linuxppc.  (4/18/00)

ximtool/ximtool-mag.c
	Increased the size of some command-line arg buffers.  This was done
	for the ximtool.c code earlier but never propogated.  (4/26/00)

xgterm/Imakefile
	Removed the '-lcurses' termlib for HP systems.  Under HP-UX 10.10
	there is a bug in the curses library select() routine which could
	cause the xgterm to hang.  (5/1/00)

------------------------
V1.2 Release  (5/1/2000)
------------------------

ximtool/tiffio.c
	Fixed a byte order problem for TIFF images on swapped systems (7/10/00)

vximtool/vximtool.c
cdl/vximtool.c
	Added an #ifdef AIX for <sys/select.h> on AIX systems (7/10/00)

obm/ObmW/Gterm.c
    Removed the comment chars for XRecolorCursor first done for MF030.
    While these do trigger BadCursor errors these will now be ignored by
    the xgterm error handler.  (4/7/00)

obm/server.c
    Changed a malloc to a calloc call for the timer struct.  Also deleted
    an XtFree for the callback in serverTimedProc() which would corrupt
    memory if the timer callback were later deleted. (7/28/00)

obm/ObmP.h
obm/Obm.c
    Added support for a new environent variable OBMOBJECTS which will help
    restrict the messages printed during debugging.  For example, it can be
    set as

        setenv OBMOBJECTS "client imagewin"

    to have OBMDEBUG print only messages for the 'client' and 'imagewin'
    objects.  (8/3/00)

ximtool/Imakefile
ximtool/ximtool.c
ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-mag.*		-
    Removed the ximtool-mag command to the 'OLD' subdirectory and merged 
    the magnifier marker into the default GUI.  (7/28/00)
    
ximtool/raster.c
ximtool/ximclient.c
ximtool/ximtool.gui
ximtool/ximtool-alt.gui
    Added new client callbacks 'centroid', 'offsetRegister' and 'setOffset'
    as part of the implementation of the DEIMOS peak-up and auto-register
    features.  (8/3/00).

ximtool/ximtool.c
    Added a check for the visual at startup so the task can exit with a
    more informative message than just the BadMatch error.  (8/3/00)

obm/client.c
obmsh/obmsh.c
xgterm/gtermio.c
ximtool/ximclient.c
    Modified the clientOutput callbacks to accept a new 'objname' argument.
    By default this will be "client" but in the case of XImtool this would
    allow a new client (the ISM) to be connected to the OBM by name.  (8/11/00)

obm/widget.c
    Added a new 'setTop' command for the Tabs widget that can be used to
    raise a particular tab from within the GUI.  (8/29/00)

ximtool/ximclient.c
ximtool/gui/print.tcl
    Minor fixes to finish implementing B5 paper size (1/8/02)

version.h
ximtool/gui/main.obj
ximtool/gui/main-alt.obj
    Updated the version string from V1.3DEVELOP to V1.3EXPORT (1/25/02)

ximtool/clients/wcspix/wcimage.x
    Fixed a bug in the WCS info computation for images which don't actually
    have a WCS, causing a segvio under sparc (1/31/02)

ximtool/gui
    Changed the default width/height of the hcut/vcut plots to 1 pixel
    from zero to avoid problems found on some X servers.  Also fixed a 
    bug in the tile-mode initialization.

-------------------------
V1.3 Release (02/03/2002)
-------------------------

ximtool/gui/global.res
    Prefixed all resources with a Class name to avoid mixups with desktop
    color settings.  (2/8/02)

ximtool/raster.c
    Modified the xim_labelTiles() procedure to draw the labels by creating
    text markers internally for each label.  This avoids problems with using
    X text drawing and allows the markers to be moved by the user as needed.
    (2/8/02)

ximtool/gui/panel.obj
ximtool/gui/tile.res
    Fixed some color problems in the GUI.  (2/8/02)

ximtool/clients/lib/dspmmap.x	(from V2.12 code)
    Added the feature that the bad pixel mask or overlay mask may be
    specified by a keyword value with the syntax !<keyword>.  This is
    important for multiextension files where various masks are set
    as keywords.  The new task OBJMASKS also writes the object mask name
    that is created for an image in the header.  Use of !objmask then
    allows the object mask to be used for the bad pixel mask (to set
    the scaling using only sky pixels) and for overlay.

cdl/vximtool.c
ximtool/raster.c
vximtool/vximtool.c
    Fixed a pointer allocation problem in the get_fbconfig() procedure
    causing a segfault.  (2/15/02)

ximtool/ximtool.c
    Fixed a bug in the -tile flag not starting up in tile mode (2/24/02)

ximtool/gui
ximtool/clients
    Reworked the code to be more efficient when doing cursor translations.
    Also disabled the BPM mapping at startup to speed startup of the ISM
    cache. (2/24/02)

ximtool/gui/main.res
ximtool/gui/main-alt.res
ximtool/gui/plots.tcl
    Changed the plotOps object to be completely resizeable and unmapped
    at the start to avoid a BadAlloc msg on sun older OW servers. (2/26/02)

ximtool/ximtool.c
    Local variable used to store the tile option wasn't properly initialized
    meaning the task could start up in tile mode. (2/28/02)

ximtool/clients/wcspix/t_wcspix.x
    The new wp_read() routine wasn't properly returning an EOF meaning the
    task could be left a zombie if the server crashed.  (2/28/02)

ximtool/gui/main.res
ximtool/gui/main-alt.res
ximtool/gui/plots.tcl
    More fixes same as above but on the cut-plot widgets. (2/28/02)

ximtool/gui/global.tcl
ximtool/gui/main-alt.obj
ximtool/gui/main.obj
    Updated GUI version strings to V1.3EXPORT from V1.3DEVELOP (2/28/02)

ximtool/gui
    Minor fixes for getting '-geometry' to work, the alt-gui resizing when
    closing the toolbars, and cut-graph geometry causing the gui to die
    on some sun systems. (3/2/02)

ximtool/iis.c
    Minor fix for ISM readout error when displaying image sections (3/3/02)

ximtool/gui
ximtool/clients/wcspix
    Implemented a "display" coordinate readout as the default when there is
    no image WCS.  This is essentially the coordinate system used by
    calculating from the frame buffer wcs and the one you get when the ISM
    isn't running.  When displaying image sections this becomes the 'physical'
    coordinate referenced to the parent image same as always rather than the
    true 'logical' coordinate that was printed previously.  (3/4/02)

install
    Fixed a bug in the install script not supplying a proper default.  (3/6/02)

ximtool/clients/wcspix/wcimage.x
    Fixed a but in the transformation of GAPPT/FK4-NO-E projections (3/20/02)

ximtool/gui/ism.tcl
ximtool/gui/compass.tcl
ximtool/clients/wcspix/wcimage.x
ximtool/clients/wcspix/wcunknown.x
    Various fixes to allow the ISM to work on transposed images (coord
    readout and compass indicator). (3/21/02)

ximtool/gui/main.obj
ximtool/gui/main.res
ximtool/gui/panel.tcl
ximtool/gui/imagewin.tcl
    The control panel Dismiss wasn't toggling the control panel button on
    the "classic" gui menubar.  Also found that there was a potential name
    conflict with objects used in the alt-gui for 'panelButton'  (3/21/02)

ximtool/iis.c
ximtool/clients/wcspix/wcimage.x
    Fixes related to coord readout when displaying image sections (3/22/02)

ximtool/gui/ism.tcl
ximtool/gui/pixtab.tcl
ximtool/clients/wcspix/wcimage.x
    Pixel table data was being sent when it wasn't needed, optimized to
    avoid this case.  (3/22/02)

----------------
Mac OS X port
----------------

./mkarch
./install
    Added branch for OS X (4/1/02)

obm/Tcl/Imakefile
    Added a branch for OS X (4/1/02)

obm/Tcl/tclInt.h
    Added an #ifdef __DARWIN__ to use <stdarg.h> instead of <varargs.h>,
    modified the va_start stuff just below that to trigger on only 
    __powerpc__ to work with both linux and darwin.

xaw3d/AsciiSrc.c
xaw3d/TextPop.c
xgterm/misc.c
ximtool/ximtool.c
    Added an #ifdef __DARWIN__ for the sys_errlist declarations (4/4/02)

xaw3d/Imakefile
    Added a case in the 'includes' to create a symlink 'Xaw' pointing to
    the x11iraf$include/X11/Xaw3d dir so we pick up the local .h files.  Some
    files, esp TextSink.h, appear broken under Darwin.  (4/5/02)

X11IRAF.tmpl
    Added a '-w' flag to the default CCOPTIONS for 'PpcDarwinArchitecture'
    to shut up the warnings.  (4/5/02)

obm/ObmW/Imakefile
obm/ObmW/icon.c		-> iconutil.c
obm/ObmW/icon.c.ORIG	-> iconutil.c.ORIG
    Incredibly filenames under OS X are case-insensitive and the 'Icon.c'
    widget source was being wiped out by the 'icon.c' utility code.  Renamed
    the file to avoid this.  (4/5/02)

obm/ObmW/Imakefile
obm/Tcl/Imakefile
     Added '-traditional-cpp' compile flags to work around the problems with
     <varargs.h>  (4/5/02)

Imakefile
    Ifdef'd out the 'make depend' for OS X since I couldn't find a way to
    make this work without getting the <varargs.h> errors that's fixed by
    the -traditional-cpp flag. (4/5/02)

obm/ObmW/Imakefile
    Added a target to 'all' to build laylex.c and laygram.c (4/5/02)

-----------------
System builds now
-----------------

obmsh/obmsh.c
    The OBMSH task would segfault in main() due to a problem with the static
    allocation of a 1Mb char buffer for the GUI message when used as a shell.
    Changed to an allocated pointer and it works now.  (4/6/02)

install
    OS X puts the app-defaults in /etc/X11/app-defaults, added that as a
    fallback for the install script prompt.  (4/6/02)

Imakefile
X11IRAF.tmpl
xaw3d/Imakefile
obm/ObmW/Imakefile
obm/Tcl/Imakefile
    Modified the PpcDarwinArchitecture defines to also check 'TenonServer'
    for systems not using the XFree86 server (4/23/02)

ximtool/iis.c
ximtool/ximtool.c
ximtool/ximclient.c
    Minor changes to allow the cmdline flags to properly disable input
    connections (fifo, etc) and show a 'disabled' status in the info box.
    Also clarified the warnings printed for EADDRINUSE and ifdef'd the
    fifo opening so it's never used (we can't write to /dev in OS X).
    (4/29/02)

------------------------------
X11IRAF V1.3 Released (5/7/02)

xaw3d/AllWidgets.c
xaw3d/XawInit.c
    Removed __DARWIN__ ifdefs around vendorShellWidgetClass definitions.
    This was put in originally to avoid link-time errors under OSX but had
    the effect of keeping the DYLD_FLAT_NAMESPACE workaround from doing
    anything.  (7/5/02)

------------------------------
X11IRAF V1.3.1 Released (7/15/02)

obm/server.c
    Modified serverActivate() to supply input focus hints to workaround 
    problems with certain window managers (e.g. FVWM2).  (7/8/02)

guidemo/table.gui
    Added demo GUI for the TABLE widget which includes "metawidget" code
    to encapsulate row/col labels, scrollbars, support routines etc around
    a simple Table widget.  The code provides an interface to a composite
    "widget" which can be instantiated any number of times and is addressed
    by a name assigned at creation time.  (10/02)

ximtool/load.c
ximtool/gui/load.tcl
    Fixed a bug where setting z1/z2 values in the Load panel would overwrite
    the z2 with the z1 value.  (10/4/02)

Imakefile
    Updated 'RELEASE' to v1.3.2 (1/14/03)

ximtool/gui/compass.tcl
ximtool/clients/wcspix/wcimage.x
    Fixed a problem in the compass indicator which assumed North was always
    either up or down.  For images where N was to the right and E up the
    rotation could legally be zero degrees but the indicator was wrong.
    Switched to a new algorithm in which the compass arms are computed
    directly from the image CD matrix.  (1/16/03)

xgterm/charproc.c
    Had to add an "#ifndef X_NOT_STDC_ENV" to include <stdlib.h> instead 
    of the char* declarations for malloc/realloc to workaround a declaration
    type conflict under FreeBSD 4.7 (1/16/03)

ximtool/fitsio.c
    Removed a restriction on the FITS header reader that the card value
    end at column 30.  Fixes a problem with FITS files produced by Image-
    Magick where BITPIX is in the "wrong" place.  (7/1/03)

vximtool/vximtool.c
    Fixed a bug in displaying to frame 16. (2/22/04)

ximtool/gui/panel.tcl
    Modified the changeFrame callback to only request image header updates
    when the panel is visible to improve response time (3/3/04)

ximtool/Imakefile
ximtool/ximtool-old.csh		+
ximtool/gui/mkgui
ximtool/gui/main.obj     -> main-old.obj
ximtool/gui/main.res     -> main-old.res
ximtool/gui/main-alt.obj -> main.obj
ximtool/gui/main-alt.res -> main.res
ximtool/gui/alt.tcl 	 -> toolbars.tcl
    Changed the default GUI for XImtool to be the 'alt' gui.   The original
    gui is accessible through an 'ximtool-old' script command, and the
    'ximtool-alt' is still around as a compatability command for people who
    have this in WM menu files.  Just typing 'ximtool' however, now brings 
    up the alt gui.  (3/3/04)
