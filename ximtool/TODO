    o	Cache a more useful default imtoolrc internally, providing more than
	just the 512sq frame buffer.


==============================================================================
OLD NOTES BELOW
==============================================================================

Miscellaneous
------------------------------

    o	Add cursor marking feature - each cursor read leaves a mark in
	the frame buffer.

------------------------------

Thoughts on priorities for next few changes:

    o	Revise menubar.  New menus, improve font.

    o	Add toggle button to map/unmap control panel.

    o	Support for command line options.

    o	Should be a way to have some system wide resource overrides without
	losing all the builtin fallback resources.

    o	Print dialog.  Add Quit confirm popup if print is enabled, so that
	an accidental menu selection doesn't terminate program.

    o	Revise info box.  Separate version and configuration information
	from output text area.  Add "messages" line for informational
	messages generated during execution.

    o	Add command entry dialog, for entering GUI commands.

    o	Add actions for common ximtool operations (frame select, zoom, pan,
	window, print, etc.) so that users can bind keys to these functions.
	Note that this can already be done using "call".

    o	Help feature.


Print dialog
    Print command:	lpr -Plw %s
    Options:
	Type of output:	postscript, EPS, sunraster
	Enhancement:	color or grayscale
	Annotation:	none, wysiwyg, manufacture
	Compression:	enabled, disabled
    Buttons:
	Print, Dismiss, Help


Info Box
    Types of information displayed
	Program version and origin
	GUI being run
	Title of current frame
	Message and status display
	Program state
	    frame buffer configuration, number of frames, frame size
	    window size, mapping from frame to window
	    active ports
	    number and type of client connections
	    number of defined colortables, current colortable
	    memory model
	    base pixel, ncolors
	    imtoolrc file - defined fb configurations
	Text output (markers etc.)


Command Entry
	command entry text widget
	    accumulate text until complete command is entered; handle
	    backslash and curly brace continuation before returning
	    command string.  callback occurs when return is hit and
	    complete command has been entered.
	command entry
	    enter command and hit return to execute
	    hitting return after executing command, with no changes,
		clears command buffer
	    use arrow keys to move up and down in history list
	command output
	    scrolled text
	debug output
	    output of print, OBMDEBUG, etc.
	    scrolled text, append
	controls
	    set debug level
	    clear output
	    done

	Support required:
	    new "command mode" callback for text widget
	    when appending text to text widget, should be able to specify
		maximum size of saved text, with automatic truncation
	    OBM - modifications to optionally direct output of print,
		debug, and error mesages to callbacks
	    OBM - need to be able to set debug level from GUI

------------------------------

1. Colormap enhancements

[DONE]	Allow arbitrary base pixel, number of gray levels; client
	colortable still has 200 entries, but if there is insufficient
	space some of them may map to the same screen pixel.

[DONE]	Option to force private colormap to be re-installed in server.

[DONE]	Figure out why colormap gets messed up when passing through
	colorbar window.

[DONE]	Optimize update_default_colormap code, which currently uses an
	inefficient technique to invert the colormap when updating the
	default colormap.

    o	Optional support for default colormap (should this be the default?)

    o	Add option to automatically invert colormap when initializing.


2. Required Features

[DONE]	Implement tile frames option.

[DONE]	Fix fitframe function.

[DONE]	Add socket i/o option.

[DONE]	Add support for simultaneous connections to multiple clients,
	maintaining the state separately for each (i.e. reference frame,
	i/o streams, etc.).

    o	Add main window button to bring up control panel.

    o	Revise main window menubar.

    o	Check out memoryModel options.

    o	Add online help.


3. Add When Time Permits

    o	"snap-to equal aspect" feature for panner window.

    o	Implement Optimize enhancement feature.

    o	Print dialog.

    o	File load/save functions.


4. Other

    o	Update manual page.  Program options, client-server protocol.


5. Optional Features

    o	Magnifier option.

    o	Split screen.

    o	Porthole option (view into alternate frame).
