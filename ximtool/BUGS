Not only does it not reset the toggle on the control panel, it doesn't
seem to cause antialiasing to happen in the main window.

I am certain that I am not zooming into a blank area of the image.
I am zooming onto the center of the image.  Zoom factors

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

work fine, but when I go from 8 to 9 the image goes black, going back
to 8 the image reappears.  Like other apparent Ximtool anomalies, this
may be a function of my having an oldish X-terminal with 8 Mbytes of
memory?

Obviously, none of this is vital.

I'll tell you first.
a) sometimes I get a display where the image sent from IRAF appears in
   the panner window but not in the main window, no matter where I
   move the window around in the whole frame.  I have soetimes cured this
   by quitting ximtool and restarting it.
b) if I use the auotscale to fit the entire image in the window, and
   the frame is not the same aspect ratio as the ximtool window, then
   I get residual image in the borders around the shrunk-to-fit full
   frame.
I can't get these consistently, although it happened several times this
evening (it makes imedit very tricky when there's no image in the main
ximtool window !!).

I don't really recognize either problem, but have a few comments

	Was the image zoomed at the time.  I do know of a bug where a zoom
factor of 9 causes this, zooming out then back in seems to cure it.

	On the wishlist is a 'snap-to-equal-aspect' option, I think this
may be what you're talking about.  To be honest I haven't played much with
the autoscale so it could be something else.
	I'll have a look at both of these but much can't be done until after
the ADASS unfortunately.  I'll see if Doug knows more about these (he was
keeper of the buglist until I started working on it, then I got my own
list of bugs!).

Oh, it's not urgent and can certainly wait until after ADASS and beyond,
but no, neither thing you mention seems relevant.  I don't want to
go to equal aspect necessarily, I just wondered why the border wasn't
cleared when I zoomed out by using auto, and the former is not affected
by anything I can do - zoom in/out, window, anything - the image is
just not there in the main window.

Anyway, just so it gets into the system somewhere so I don't feel
quite so lonely with my problems (neither JB nor Dave B had seen or
heard of missing images of this sort).

Time for me to move on - you go on back to ADASS - or your mailing
problem - I have to sleep for a bit.

Mike,

It seems that the print window text entry for "lpr" also needs
a CR to accept a revision. For example, if I want to enter "lpr -Plw9",
I must hit CR, or the default of "lpr" is used.

I haven't looked at the "Save As..." window, but it may suffer similarly.

Mike,

I found a couple of oddities in Ximtool.

1. Loading an image into a frame buffer clears other frame buffers.
   I tried to load a GIF file into frame 1, and another into frame 2.
   Only the last image loaded survived.

2. In the load panel, one must hit RETURN after entering a file name
   before the load will occur via the LOAD button. This is similar to 
   earlier problems with the typing buffers.

3. Also in a typing buffer, if I highlight text and then begin typing, 
   I expect the highlighted text to be deleted. Instead, the new text
   is inserted along with the old text.
