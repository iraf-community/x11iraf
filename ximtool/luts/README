This directory contains a collection of lookup tables compiled from various
sources.  The origin of most of these was Klaus Banse of the MIDAS project.
The ultimate source of many of the tables is unknown.

To have the colortables in this directory loaded automatically by Ximtool
install them in the directory

	/usr/local/lib/imtoolcmap/

Or, to load colortables from a custom directory set the cmapDir1 or cmapDir2
ximtool resource to the pathname of the directory containing the tables.

The format of a user lookup table is very simple: each row defines one
colortable entry, and consists of three columns defining the red, green,
and blue values scaled to the range 0.0 (off) to 1.0 (full intensity).

	R G B
	R G B
	(etc.)

Blank lines and comment lines (# ...) are ignored.

Usually 256 rows are provided, but the number may actually be anything
in the range 1 to 256.  Ximtool will interpolate the table as necessary
to compute the colortable values used in Ximtool.  Ximtool uses only
201 colors to render pixel data, so it is usually necessary to interpolate
the table when it is loaded.

Tables are loaded into Ximtool by setting one of the user colormap directory
resources.  When Ximtool starts up it will read all the files in the
colormap directory, disregarding any files that are unreadable or that do
not appear to be colortables.  The name of the colortable as it will appear
in the Ximtool control panel is the root name of the file, e.g., if the
file is "rainbow.lut" the colortable name will be "rainbow".  Lower case
names are suggested to avoid name collisions with the builtin colortables.
If the same colortable file appears in multiple user colortable directories,
the first one will be used.
