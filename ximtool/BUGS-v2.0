1/13	- Compass needs a redraw after a new image display
	- Vertical plot marker slow to update when horizontal plot open
???	- Reports of ism_wcspix.e crash
11/8	- GUI layout sizes when plots are closed
	- "X" window button closes entire app

11/8	- Max app version
11/1	- Check for "v1.3" in gui/docs
	- color9 on plot backgrounds not showing up properly
	- Opening vertical cut-plot first expands window too wide, doing
	  horizontal first is okay

11/4	- Compass color shows up as red, should be yellow
	- Window resize breaks colormap focus box
11/4	- Compass doesn't respond to X/Y flips 
	- When using image data for cut-plots, need to reset plot scale
	- Zoom-out => cursor readout becomes invalid when off-image
		   => magnifier doesn't show black background, shows parts
		      of the previous background image
11/10	- Resetting the cmap focus box size to less than the full window
	  and changing the colormap from the control panel updates only
	  the focus box on the display.
11/10	- Displaying dev$pix into two frames and using the 'Match' button
	  doesn't clear the entire frame buffer with the background 
	  color
11/10	- Frames display with different colormaps only update to the size of
	  the cmap focus box when switching frames.
11/10	- Background and text colors for Tcl shell, Info panel, etc "not right"
11/10	- Ctrl-a sets toggles the Auto-register but doesn't reset the toolbar
	  button

11/18	- BadAlloc from XCreatePixmqp seen on some systems (e.g. Leopard PPC)
12/1	- BadValue error from XQueryColors on Leopard Intel systems.
	  Complaint is about color '0x2f4f4f' (color9=darkslategrey, used in
	  hcut/vcut in GUI and main color9 resource definition).  Duplicated 
	  on Leopard/PPC but only with 15-plane colors (i.e.  'Thousands' in 
	  X11 display preferences).
11/20	- ISM prints 'bad fd' (and perhaps also a 'memory corrupted') message
	  when quitting ximtool
	- The -alt and -old script use of '+' flag on "tail" doesn't work
	  on newer linux systems
12/5	- Save panel doesn't save a tiled screen display, just the current
	  display to a window the size of the display
	- On PPC systems, Save shows a yellow background for PseudoColor GIF
	- Colormap focus box wrong size for e.g. imt4096 zoomed out
12/3	- Print box on Leopard PPC shows garbage status and crashes
