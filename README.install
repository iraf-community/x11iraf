BUILDING FROM SOURCES

Before building x11iraf you should check the archives on iraf.noao.edu (or
it's mirror sites) to see if there are already pre-built binaries available
for your platform.

To build x11iraf type, in the x11iraf root directory,

    % xmkmf
    % make World		# (or preferably, make World >& spool &)

This will do a "make World", build everything, and install into the x11iraf
bin and other install directories.  To install somewhere else you can manually
move the binaries to /usr/local/bin or wherever you wish to install them.
Alternatively the X11IRAF.tmpl file can be edited to customize the install.
The minimal install requires moving the executables in bin to a public
directory, and installing the app-defaults files "XGterm" and "XTapemon".
ximtool does not require installation of an app-defaults file.  See the
manual pages for more detailed configuration instructions.

To build the GUIDEMO IRAF package type "mkpkg" in the guidemo directory.

The LIB and INCLUDE directories should be referenced in applications which
use any of the x11iraf libaries (libobm.a, libXaw3d.a, libXpm.a, libcdl.a).


USING THE INSTALL SCRIPT

To install the files you can use the new 'install' script by logging in as
the root user and issuing the command:

                # ./install

Just answer the questions about path destinations and the files will be
moved automatically.  Root permissions are required to install the files to
system diretories, however the install script can be used by "normal" users
wishing to install in a private directory.


BINARY DISTRIBUTION INSTALLATION

The binary distributions are all that are required to use the package.
Binaries may be installed in any place normally in the user's path but
we recommend something like the following

    % mv bin.<arch>/* /usr/local/bin			# for the binaries
    % mv lib.<arch>/* /usr/local/lib			# for the CDL library
    % mv include/* /usr/local/include			# for CDL include files
    % mv app-defaults/* /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults	# app resource defaults
    % mv man/* /usr/man/man1				# man pages

The CDL file installation is not required unless you plan to use it for
building local applications.  The app-defaults file are for XGterm and
XTapemon.  Note that on Sun systems these files may need to be installed
in the /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults directory.
