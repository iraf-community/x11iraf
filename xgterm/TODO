				XGTERM - TODO



Imaging Support  (July 1993)

	Gterm widget
	    debug polygon marker code
	    debug fill area support
	    implement missing read-raster primitive
	    add resource to set cursor type

	Object manager
	    add gterm widget support (subclass)
		bindings for standard actions
		support for pixel tagging
		callbacks for image events? (e.g. raster actions)
	    add support for timers and background work functions
	    debug or trace mode for Tcl interpreter
	    improved error handling and recovery
	    flesh out support for standard widgets (menu, text, etc.)
	    evaluate other widgets (Xc, FWF, layout)

	Xgterm
	    hack event handling to support timers
	    add missing arguments, resources

	IRAF
	    file include capability for .gui file
	    interactive background mode (bkg GUIs)
	    stdimage which uses stdgraph kernel


Imaging Support  (April 1993)

	subraster updates do not always overlap on screen		[DONE]
	check out frame buffer editing (partial instructions)		[DONE]
	custom cursor bitmap for crosshair cursor			[DONE]
	colormap - initialize table for static entries			[DONE]

	add colormap number to GIM read/write colormap (0=screen)	[DONE]
	implement polygon clipping code in gio/cursor			[DONE]
	what to do about raster mapping after window resize		[DONE]
	add NDC-GIM coordinate conversions primitives to GIM ?		[DONE]
	add support for alternate GKI|GIM coordinates to GIM		[DONE]

	general problem of cursor input and rasters/mappings		[DONE]
	    return cursor coordinate in GKI units scaled to raster?	[DONE]

	resolve problem of multiple gterms with color tables		[DONE]
	    private colormap
	    share with other gterms (e.g. using properties)
	    reload colormap on focus-in event?
	    allocate private colormap if 256 cells requested?
	add tcl callable windowing function (midpoint, slope)		[DONE]
	    window display pixels by diddling colormap
	    regenerate display pixels from ximage (or from client)
	add tcl callable region drawing facilities			[DONE]
	    draw, erase, shape; how is interaction handled
	add support for getting x/y/z from client and getting x/y/z
	    string given raster pixel coordinate
	add tcl support for text display in the gterm window.  can be	[DONE]
	    combined with above for coord display

	implement GIM functions in interpreter (callbacks?)
	implement missing read-raster primitive
	add tcl access to gterm widget drawing functions?
	add resource to set ginmode, busy cursor types
	check out menu stuff

	add get/put cell array (NDC coords) to GIO
	add get/put colormap to GIO

	add gtermio resource to set ginmode terminators
	add gtermio resource to set emulation type

	what about stdgraph/stdimage?  one possibility is for standard
	    xgterm GUI to provide separate graph, image windows automatically
	    selectable by graphics stream

	start up interactive bkg jobs in own xgterm


Client Applications  (May 1993)

	Clean up Xgterm client (setup menus etc.)
	write Ximtool client
	Demo clients, further testing of object manager and widget stuff
	    imbrowse
	    movie program
	    simple image display task using GIO
