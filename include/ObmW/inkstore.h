** "Rationale for the ink specification"
**
** This document defines a storage and interchange format for embedded ink
** data.  The format is device- and platform-independent.  The goal is to
** provide application programs on the same and different platforms and
** operating systems a way to store and exchange ink data.  Thus a PenPoint
** user might scribble a note and send the untranslated ink as part of an
** e-mail message to a colleague's pen computer running Windows for Pen
** Computing using Magic Mail.
**
** This specification is for a publicly-defined, external format for
** electronic ink data interchange, and neither assumes nor dictates the
** nature of how the application deals with ink data internally.  The format
** is not intended to be the "internal" ink format of an application, though
** there is no reason why it could not serve such a purpose. 
**
** The scope and goals of this format design are limited to the represent-
** ation of electronic ink data embedded in some other electronic document, 
** not to the larger document itself (such as an e-mail or enhanced word-
** processing data file).
**
** The approach taken is to capture the complete user input for the
** electronic ink, including not just X/Y coordinates, but also a large set
** of current drawing attributes such as nib type and ink color.  This
** differs from other possible approaches, such as those based on certain
** recognition models for handwritten text, which require decomposing the
** handwritten ink data first into a set of pre-defined approximation curves
** or sub-strokes, and then storing a list of encodings of these sub-strokes.
** In other words, Jot preserves all information about the original input as
** opposed attempting any sort of abstract characterization of the input.
** 
** The storage format has a number of properties:
** 
** * Simple.  Typical operations on the ink data are easy.  If you only wish
**   to read stroke coordinates and bounding information from the data,
**   complex information that might be present will not hinder the process.
**   Likewise, it is easy to write out just simple information.  The
**   complex information is all optional.
** 
** * Compact.  The storage format is intended to be as compact as possible 
**   without sacrificing simplicity or fidelity.  Optional information such
**   as time stamps or color specifications occupy space only when they are
**   present.  Specifications that apply to many strokes (such as line width
**   or color) are represented just once.
** 
** * Compression.  The stroke information that describes the ink can
**   optionally be represented in a compressed format.  Compression
**   techniques include both compression and reduction of the ink data.
** 
** * Inclusive.  The format is capable of storing every property of ink
**   conceivable as of today.  
** 
** * Expandable and Compatible.  The format is expandable, so as developers
**   discover new information that should be recorded in an ink storage
**   format, these new features can be added without changing the behavior of
**   existing application programs working with an older version of the
**   format.  In general, new features can generally be ignored by
**   applications reading older versions of the format.  Likewise, new
**   application programs can handle previous versions of the format without
**   special work.
** 
** The format is not designed to easily support lots of in-memory
** manipulation of the ink data, such as deleting strokes, changing line
** widths, and so on.  A format supporting these types of manipulations would
** be at odds with the above goals.  All the information needed to perform
** these manipulations is present in this data format, so an application
** might augment this format to facilitate manipulation of the ink data.
** 
** Applications are likely to use some other format internally for real-time
** ink manipulation.  Many operating environments provide some internal means
** for storing and manipulating ink data, the details of which may be hidden
** to some extent from the application designer.  Many such real-time data
** structures store fewer types of and/or less information (such as not
** preserving information about the tablet point data rate) than are covered
** in this definition.

**
** Revision History:
**
** March    16, 1992 - First public draft.
** July     13, 1992 - Major rewrite to put data into a series of records.
** July     19, 1992 - Inclusion of ink-compacting definitions.
** July     30, 1992 - Change of target rect to offset.
** December 28, 1992 - Changes incorporated from August 1992 review meeting.
** February 12, 1993 - Incremental fixes due to coding experience.
** March    13, 1993 - Revised definition of a "group".
** April    12, 1993 - Release of version 0.99 of the specification.  Moved
**                     reference sections 28 and 29 to a separate file called
**                     sample.h
** May      01, 1993 - Release of version 1.00 of the specification.  
**                     Changed INK_OFFSET_RECORD units from twips to pen 
**                     units for consistency and ease of implementation.
**                     Fixed a typo in reference section 26.0 in the diagram.
**                     The text accompanying the diagram was correct.
**                     Fixed a typo in reference section 27.0.  The old text
**                     "delta-X == 0 or 1" was replaced with the correct text
**                     "delta-X == 2".  The accompanying diagram was correct.
**                     Removed all sizeof() constructs and replaced with 
**                     appropriate #defines to reduce compiler dependencies.
**                     Tagged all struct definitions with tag_ prefix.
**                     Added comments and reordered some existing comments.
** May      17, 1993 - Added a few more _SIZE #defines, clarified reserved
**                     values.

**
** GENERAL NOTES
** -------------
**
**
** Record Structure
** ----------------
**
** If not otherwise specified, all words are stored in Intel order: low-order
** word first, then high-order word, and inside of a word,  low-order byte,
** then high-order byte.  For example, a 32 bit quantity 0x12345678 would be
** written to the file as 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12.  The notable exception is the
** storage of point data in "standard compression" format.  Sign bits are
** used to indicate item types, so the bytes are stored high-order to low-
** order (exactly opposite).  See the sample code and reference section 23.0
** for more information on the compressed format.  Uncompressed data is 
** written in Intel order.
**
** All structures are packed for the purposes of writing to a stream.
** 
** Signed integer values are two's-complement.  Rectangles are stored 
** x,y,w,h.
**
** These definitions are intended to insulate the sample ink compaction and
** storage code from any possible variation in item alignment or structure
** packing across architectures.  The only possible area of portability
** concern lies in the use of unions in colors (see 11.0) and pen tips (see
** 14.0).
**
** Any use of units of mass to denote units of force ("grams of force"), or
** similar common misuses of physical units, are noted here with an apology
** to any purists, and should be interpreted in the common way by assuming
** one standard gravity.
**
** Record Sequence
** ---------------
**
** In this document, one piece of ink data is called an ink bundle. 
** Typically this might correspond to the strokes that make up the ink from
** the time when the pen touches down until the user finishes writing
** (usually determined by a timeout or the pen leaving proximity).  Thus an
** ink bundle usually contains many ink strokes, and the strokes do not have
** to describe a continuous line of ink.
** 
** As stated in reference section 5.0, all data conforming to this
** specification appears as a stream of ink bundles each of which must begin
** with an INK_BUNDLE_RECORD and end with an INK_END_RECORD.  There may be
** more than one INK_BUNDLE_RECORD/INK_END_RECORD pair in a given stream.
** A record stream might look something like this:
**
** INK_BUNDLE_RECORD       required    // for bundle number one
** INK_SCALE_RECORD        optional    // sets the scale for rendering
** INK_OFFSET_RECORD       optional    // sets the offset for rendering
** INK_COLOR_RECORD        optional    // sets the color for rendering
** INK_START_TIME_RECORD   optional    // sets the relative start time
** INK_PENTIP_RECORD       optional    // sets the pentip for rendering
** INK_GROUP_RECORD        optional    // tags the following PENDATA
** INK_PENDATA_RECORD      recommended // actual points
** INK_GROUP_RECORD        optional    // tags the following PENDATA
** INK_PENDATA_RECORD      recommended // actual points 
** INK_PENDATA_RECORD      recommended // more points in same group
** INK_SCALE_RESET_RECORD  optional    // resets to default scaling/offset
** INK_PENDATA_RECORD      recommended // actual points
** INK_END_TIME_RECORD     optional    // relative time inking ended
** INK_END_RECORD          required    // end of bundle number one
**
** It is perfectly reasonable to write out only the following (though doing
** so will cause the ink to be rendered in a completely default manner -- 
** black hairline width at 1:1 scaling with offset 0):
**
** INK_BUNDLE_RECORD
** INK_PENDATA_RECORD
** INK_END_RECORD
** 
**
** Specification Revisions
** -----------------------
** 
** Future enhancements to this specification may modify certain record types.
** It is guaranteed that any record modified in a subsequent revision of the 
** specification will be a strict superset of that record's definition in any
** previous revision of the specification.  That is, modified record types 
** will only be lengthened, not shortened.  If a particular record type must
** be extended such that it would not be a superset of the original, a new 
** record type would be added to cover that particular extension.
** 
** This extension strategy has two important ramifications: 
**
** 1) A reading application should *ALWAYS* use the size of a record as 
**    recorded in the record structure itself (i.e., the recordLength field
**    of the INK_RECORD_HEADERx structure) rather than the sizeof() or any
**    other size determined at compile time to determine how may bytes to 
**    read as the data structures are parsed.  This is due to the fact that 
**    a record may grow in a future revision of the standard.  The only
**    exception to this rule is the INK_BUNDLE_RECORD which contains a
**    version number that will be modified with each change to that record.
**    If an INK_BUNDLE_RECORD is encountered and its version matches the
**    version used at compile time, the size of the record should exactly
**    match the #define of inkRecordBundleSize.
**
** 2) Any particular record may be read into a target data structure up to 
**    the size of the target data structure and the rest may be ignored.  
**    This is due to the 'strict superset' rule which means that any 
**    extension of any record type must leave the meaning, content, and size
**    of any existing fields as is.  So, for example, if an INK_SCALE_RECORD
**    was modified by adding 2 bytes, the reading application can safely read
**    the data into the INK_SCALE_RECORD known at compile time and throw
**    away the extra two bytes: the header, x, and y will be in the same 
**    place and will have the same meaning.
**
** 
** Files of Ink
** ------------
**
** It is a recommended practice on DOS and UNIX style file systems to use the
** extension ".JOT" for files consisting solely of ink recorded according to
** this specification.  The specification is designed such that ink data can
** be embedded inside any file format and if such a file contains more than
** strictly ink data, it should not use the .JOT extension.

** A block of ink data is called an ink bundle.  Each ink bundle consists of
** a series of n records.  Each record has a common header that indicates the
** record type and the record length.  An ink bundle always starts with an
** INK_BUNDLE_RECORD and always ends with an INK_END_RECORD.
**
** Any records of unknown type can be skipped by simply reading the length of

**
** Note:
** Within an ink bundle, time increases.  This implies a drawing order of

** is also back-to-front.

** A number of record types are defined.  The most common is the

** The INK_BUNDLE_FLAGS contain some flags that apply to an entire bundle. 
** If you wanted to store several pieces of ink that had different
** INK_BUNDLE_FLAGS, you would do it by storing several different bundles.
**
** Advisory flags:
**
** inkPointsRemoved         
**      Indicates whether all original points are still present or whether
**      some points were removed to save space.  For applications that are
**      only interested in the visual aspects of ink, many points can be
**      removed that do not affect the appearance (i.e. duplicate points,
**      collinear points, points which deviate less than some screen
**      resolution, etc..).  Some other types of applications must know that
**      points are present at some consistent sampling rate (i.e. some forms
**      of handwriting translation).  This flag indicates whether all
**      original points are still there.
**
**      Note:
**      The purpose of "inkPointsRemoved" is to indicate that the timing
**      information cannot be accurately derived by counting points:
**      replacing individual points with an "elided point" item does not
**      constitute removing points. ("Elided" means omitted or skipped).
**
** inkProxDataRemoved   
**      Indicates that the original points between strokes (proximity) were
**      removed to save space.  An out-of-prox point should be stored between
**      strokes to delimit them.  Some applications depend on knowing the
**      time between strokes or at the ends of strokes for certain
**      functions. 
**
**      Note:
**      "Proximity" is defined as the stylus being close enough to the tablet
**      for the tablet to report the stylus position, although perhaps at
**      lower accuracy and perhaps at a lower number of points per second.  A
**      recommended practice is to include "out of proximity" points in the
**      recorded ink data when they are used as part of determining the
**      amount of time a stylus was out of contact with the tablet, or for
**      triggering the completion of an action such as a "gesture". 
**
** inkStrokeLimitsPresent   
**      Indicates that INK_BUTTONS items are also present, and that they
**      indicate what the storing app decided the stroke start/end points
**      were. (Note: the reading application may otherwise use a different
**      algorithm for using tip force values to delimit strokes.) 
**
**      Note:
**      If inkStrokeLimitsPresent is set, then inkButtonDataPresent must also
**      be set. 
**
** Data flags:
**
**  inkAngleDataPresent     indicates angle data is present.
**  inkForceDataPresent     indicates force data is present.
**  inkProxDataPresent      indicates points are present when pen is lifted
**                          up (i.e. the force drops below some threshold).
**  inkRotationDataPresent  indicates pen rotation data is present.
**  inkHeightDataPresent    indicates pen height data is present.
**  inkButtonDataPresent    indicates "button state" information is present.
**  inkPreMultiplyScale     indicates that scaling should be applied before
**                          the offset value is added ("pre-multiply")
**                          rather than after ("post-multiply")
**
** Note: 
** A previous draft version included a provision for compacting data to an
** approximation based on Bezier curves.  Initial results did not show
** promise in terms of efficiency and performance.
**
** "inkBezierRepresentation" would have indicated that the X/Y ordinates
** reflected a Bezier approximation to the original tablet data.  This would
** have meant that the ordinate data represented aggregates of anchor points
** and control points for each piece wise approximation, and therefore could
** not be used directly to render the data.  The definition of these anchor
** and control points, and the example code for the approximation and
** regeneration of the "true" coordinates could not be worked out at this
** time. 
**
** Some standard values for pen units per meter follow:
**
** 1000 points per inch digitizer == 39370 pen units per meter
**  500 points per inch digitizer == 19685 pen units per meter
**  200 points per inch digitizer ==  7874 pen units per meter
**  254 points per inch (1/10 mm) == 10000 pen units per meter
**
** 1000 pen units per meter is a reasonable minimum; 400,000 is a reasonable
** maximum value.
**
** The specific format for each of these types of data is described in the
** INK_PENDATA_RECORD documentation (reference section 8.0).
** 
** Note:
** The order in which these flags are defined has nothing to do with the
** order in which the data appears in the INK_POINT structure when reading
** or writing point data.  For more information, see reference section 21.0.

** A penData record contains the actual pen data for one or more pen strokes.
** The bounds applies to all the strokes contained within this record. 
** Multiple strokes are typically grouped into one record to increase the
** efficiency of the compression algorithm, though strokes may be stored
** individually, if desired.
**
** The bounds is the pure mathematical bounds of the raw pen points and does
** not take into account any rendering information such as the pen tip or the
** line width.  All points in the INK_PENDATA have been normalized relative
** to the lower bounds in the INK_PENDATA header.
**
** Some applications will prefer to know the bounds of individual strokes.
** This can be accomplished in two ways.
**
** 1) The bounds for a given stroke can be computed when reading the file
**    by decompressing an INK_PENDATA_RECORD into its strokes and then
**    traversing the points in each stroke to build the bounds for each
**    stroke.
**
** 2) An application can decide to store only one stroke per
**    INK_PENDATA_RECORD (and thus the bounds of the PENDATA_RECORD is
**    already the bounds of one stroke).  The sacrifice here is in
**    compression efficiency and the need to still support reading files
**    written by other applications that might group multiple strokes
**    into a single INK_PENDATA_RECORD.
**
** Note: 
** In practice, our experience is that unpacking the data in order to compute
** the bounds for each stroke to check for strokes that intrude into a given
** region is not an excessive burden.  The checks that would have been done
** on the bounds of each stroke can be done on the builds for each penData
** group, and not all strokes must be checked individually.
**
** The format of the pen data is determined by the settings for
** compactionType and flags in the INK_BUNDLE_RECORD structure, and
** is described later in this file.  Two formats are currently defined:
** an uncompacted format and a delta-encoded compacted format, both with
** optional components present or absent depending on the state of the flags

** Ink scale is recorded in two fixed point values.  A unity scale (scale
** of one) is represented as 0x00010000, a scale of 0.5 as 0x00008000.
**
** Note:
** All ink is located relative to the lower-left (0,0) corner of a logical 
** page or window.  Scale and offset operations are cumulative, much in the 
** same way as in PostScript.  One begins with a normalized graphics state
** and sequentially applies the scale and offset operations to that matrix. 
** The INK_SCALE_RESET record returns the graphics state to its default state
** (i.e., the transformation matrix is set to an identity matrix and the
** offset is reset to the default of 0).  By default, scaling is applied
** after adding in any offset specified in an INK_OFFSET_RECORD.  If the ink
** bundle has the inkPreMultiplyScale bit set, for all ink in that bundle
** scaling is applied before adding in any offset.
** 
** As used in this format, ink scale and offset values are set by the storing
** application, to be applied by the rendering application.  If the storing
** application collected the ink at scales of (2.0,2.0), the storing
** application should insert an INK_SCALE_RECORD with a scale of (0.5,0.5)
** for the rendering application to multiply all ink X and Y coordinates by.
**
** It is the responsibility of the storing application to deal with any 
** effects from round-off or truncation error due to the limits of precision
** in the FIXED_FRACTION values used in INK_SCALE_RECORDs.
**
** An ink scale record indicates a scale change that stays in effect until
** another ink scale record is encountered.  Ink scale values compound: if
** the current scale is (2.0,2.0) and an INK_SCALE_RECORD is encountered with
** scale of (2.0,3.0), the scale to be applied to ink then becomes(4.0,6.0). 
** In absence of any ink scale record, the default ink scale is unity.  In
** general, a typical usage pattern for an application that supports drawing
** ink while zoomed at scale is to record a number of strokes at a given
** scale, reset the scale with an INK_SCALE_RESET_RECORD (which resets both
** the scale and the offset to the default values), then switch to another
** scale, then record a number more strokes, and so on.
**
** Note:
** The extension scaling and offset to the Z ordinate value is not defined in
** this version of the specification.  The extension to Z scaling and offset
** in a "standard" record type (i.e. not an application-specific record) may
** be addressed in the future.

** The offset position is used to relocate ink data, after scaling.  For
** example, in a forms application, ink in a sketch field is drawn relative
** to a given sketch field in the form.  The location of this original field
** is important to know so we know how the ink in this bundle relates to its
** original field.  If we wanted to move this ink to another field (i.e.
** cut/paste or move), we would need to know the location of the original
** field so we could render the ink in the new field in a manner consistent
** with how it was drawn relative to its original field (i.e. a similar
** baseline for a hand-written signature).
**
** This record is optional.  If it exists, it will then apply to all
** following pen data in the file.  If it is not present it is assumed that
** no information of this type is relevant.  For example, while field ink
** would have an offset position, markup ink over an entire form would not
** have a offset position (or would have an offset position of (0,0) and a
** scale of (1,1)) because it is relative to the entire form coordinate
** system, not relative to some piece in the form.

** tip will be application specific, but this record states what pen tip
** parameters were used by the storing app.
**
** Pen tips determine, in part, how ink is rendered.  For pen tip types
** defined in future versions of this format which require additional
** parameters (such as the X and Y rectangle for a simulated nib pen, or
** brush dimensions for a simulated brush), additional data is included
** at the end of the structure.
**
** The writing application should be aware that the reading application will
** only do "the best possible" job of rendering and that fully compliant 
** reading applications may not be able to render certain nib types and/or
** colors.  Both reading and writing applications should pay particular
** attention to the following notes regarding defaults and ink drawn at a
** width of zero.
** 
** A pen tip which is drawing ink in zero width renders at the minimum
** visible width the reading application will support.
** 
** A recommended practice is that ink which should not render (should this
** be called for) be drawn with a color value of (0,0,0, 0), i.e., black,
** completely transparent.
**
** Pen tip size should scale when an INK_SCALE_RECORD is encountered.  The
** writing application should write a new INK_PENTIP_RECORD after an
** INK_SCALE_RECORD if the writing application does not want the pen tip
** size to scale along with the ink.  If the pen tip scales to zero width, 
** it should be rendered by the reading application according to the comment
** above.
**
** The default pen tip if no pentip record exists is INK_PENTIP_ROUND, with a
** width of one twip.  The dimensions of a round nib specify diameter, not
** radius: the X/Y coordinate is the center of this diameter.  Similarly, for
** for rectangular nibs, the X/Y coordinate is the center of the rectangle.  
**
** Note:
** This specification does not specify information for an algorithmic
** variation in nib width, ink color, or other "brush" effects as a function
** of tip force, speed or any other factor.  An example would be for an
** application to draw wider ink as the user presses down harder with the
** stylus.  Applications wishing to implement such features may do so using
** application-specific record types for this revision of the specification.

**
** The INK_POINT structure has the following elements:
**
** position - required and always present
**    Positions are measured with (0,0) at the lower-left, X increasing to
**    the right, Y increasing upwards.  Values are actually S31, not S32.
**    The high bit in X and Y must be zero.
** force    - optional, present if inkForceDataPresent is asserted
**    Units are in pen force units, zero is no contact.
** height   - optional, present if inkHeightDataPresent is asserted
**    Units are in pen unitsPerZ as specified by inkPointDefaultUnitsPerZ or
**    by an INK_UNITS_PER_Z_RECORD, whichever is appropriate.  Units increase
**    as the stylus is taken away from the tablet.  Zero means "just in 
**    contact".  Negative values could possibly result from spring action if
**    the stylus is pressed hard, or if the tablet is not perfectly accurate.
** rho      - optional, present if inkRotationDataPresent is asserted
**    Angles are measured in degrees from some nominal orientation of 
**    "stylus button on top" (somewhat arbitrary).  Angles increase with 
**    clockwise rotation as seen from the rear end of the stylus.
** angle    - optional, present if inkAngleDataPresent is asserted
**    Angles are measured in pen angle units from the vertical.  Theta 
**    increases in the positive-X direction, phi in the positive-Y.
** buttons  - optional, present if inkButtonDataPresent is asserted
**    
** When the INK_BUNDLE_RECORD member compactionType is inkStdCompression,
** all data in this structure is compressed according to the methods 
** described in reference section 23.0.  For more details on how to interpret

** compacted button data or elided point data may be encountered instead, and
** 2) when the inkButtonDataPresent flag is asserted in the bundle header,
** button data will appear in the place of a point and not in addition to a
** point.  If inkButtonDataPresent is not asserted, the reader need not check
** the point data for the special case of button data; however, the point

** Compacted point format:
** ---------------------
**
** A recommended practice is always to use the compacted point format, not
** the uncompacted point format.  Sample code for reading and writing the
** compacted format is included in an appendix.  
**
** This structure also immediately follows the rest of the
** INK_PENDATA_RECORD.
**
** The uncompacted values above are stored in sequential bytes in a more
** compact, delta-oriented format.  Deltas are all signed values, a value to
** add to the previous value.  The first point in an INK_PENDATA_RECORD is
** always relative to the defined default values for each component of the
** point.
**
** The storing application, as an alternative to eliminating points, can
** specify a "skip" record for elided points.  The skipRecord indicates that
** a number of points were skipped, and the reading application is free to
** insert values for the elided points (interpolating where appropriate). 
** The intent is to allow for accurate time information to be maintained
** between time stamps for synchronization with recorded voice, press-hold
** gesture recognition, etc.  
**
** Compacted data is written most significant byte first so that reading
** applications can read the first byte and determine (from the top two bits)
** how large the encoded delta is.
**
** Note:
** "Reserved encodings" are those encodings that, if real points, would fit
** into the next smaller delta size.  16 bit deltas and 8 bit deltas have
** reserved encodings.  The reserved encodings for 16 bit deltas are all 16
** bit delta pairs where both X and Y are within the inclusive range MIN_S7
** and MAX_S7.  Similarly, the reserved encoding for 8 bit deltas are all 8
** bit delta pairs where both X and Y are within the inclusive range MIN_S3
** and MAX_S3.  In revision 1.0 of Jot, three of the reserved encodings for 8
** bit deltas are used for special cases: skip counts (reference section 
** 27.0) and button changes (reference section 26.0).

**              (delta-X)           (delta-Y)
**
** An eight-bit delta with delta-X == 0 or 1, and delta-Y in the range
** (-4..3) indicates a button state encoding. 
**
** It is likely to be the case that many hardware platforms have only one
** barrel button.
**
** The three delta-Y bits indicate the "touch", "out-of-prox", and "first
** barrel button" state as follows:
**
** low-order         delta-Y bit: 1 --> in proximity,    0 --> out of prox
** next              delta-Y bit: 1 --> touching tablet, 0 --> not touching
** high-order (sign) delta-Y bit: 1 --> first button closed, 0 --> open
**
**
** The lowest order bit of the delta-X bits is used to indicate that
** additional bytes follow: "1" indicates that the next byte is used for the
** next 7 barrel buttons with state.  The high order bit of each sequential 
** byte in the series is "1" if an additional byte must be fetched, "0"
** otherwise.  In these additional bytes, the additional buttons are 
** associated in order starting with the low-order bit.

**
** An eight-bit delta with delta-X == 2, and delta-Y in the range
** (-4..3) indicates a count of elided points.  The delta-Y values in the
** range (-4..-1) are used to represent skip counts of (4..7).  If the
** delta-Y value is zero "0", the next two bytes are fetched to get a U16
** skip count value.
**
** The elided points are points removed between the point immediately prior
** to the skipped-point record and the point immediately afterward.  This 
** implies that at least one point must follow every skip record (though 
** the point may not appear next in the stream if there are intervening
** button state transitions).  Reading applications that are interested in 
** recovering elided points will typically interpolate.  Skip counts of zero
** are meaningless and not permitted.
