This file lists all copyright holders and all licenses for this package.
Due to the age of the software, it is almost impossible to assign specific
licenses to individual files. Most of the files were edited several times by
different copyright holders, and the changes may have a different license. All
licenses are permissible OSI compliant licenses.
