OBM -- Object Manager library.  This library implements a window system
toolkit as an interpreted window-object language, allowing application GUIs
to be defined and executed at runtime without compiling any code, and with
minimal dependence upon the underlying window system toolkit library.
The object manager is used in X11 client applications such as the IRAF widget
server, which is basically just the object manager packaged as a server that
remote client applications can connect to to download and execute a GUI.

See obm.c for an overview of the library.
