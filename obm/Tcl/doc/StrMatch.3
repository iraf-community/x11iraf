.SH NAME
Tcl_StringMatch \- test whether a string matches a pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_StringMatch\fR(\fIstring\fR, \fIpattern\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS

String to test.
.AP char *pattern in
Pattern to match against string.  May contain special
characters from the set *?\e[].

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This utility procedure determines whether a string matches
a given pattern.  If it does, then \fBTcl_StringMatch\fR returns
1.  Otherwise \fBTcl_StringMatch\fR returns 0.  The algorithm
used for matching is the same algorithm used in the ``string match''
Tcl command and is similar to the algorithm used by the C-shell
for file name matching;  see the Tcl manual entry for details.

.SH KEYWORDS
match, pattern, string
