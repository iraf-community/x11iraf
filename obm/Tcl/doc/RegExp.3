.SH NAME
Tcl_RegExpMatch \- Test whether a string matches a regular expression
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR(\fIinterp\fR, \fIstring\fR, \fIregexp\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter to use for error reporting.
.AP char *string in
String to test.
.AP char *regexp in
Regular expression to match against \fIstring\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR determines whether its \fIstring\fR argument
matches \fIregexp\fR, where \fIregexp\fR is interpreted
as a regular expression using the same rules as for the
\fBregexp\fR Tcl command.
If there is a match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 1.
If there is no match then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR returns 0.
If an error occurs in the matching process (e.g. \fIregexp\fR
is not a valid regular expression) then \fBTcl_RegExpMatch\fR
returns \-1 and leaves an error message in \fIinterp->result\fR.

.SH KEYWORDS
