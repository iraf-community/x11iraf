.SH SYNOPSIS
.VS
\fBconcat\fI \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command treats each argument as a list and concatenates them
into a single list.
It also eliminates leading and trailing spaces in the \fIarg\fR's
and adds a single separator space between \fIarg\fR's.
It permits any number of arguments.  For example,
the command
.DS
\fBconcat a b {c d e} {f {g h}}\fR
.DE
will return
.DS
\fBa b c d e f {g h}\fR
.DE
as its result.
.PP
.VS
If no \fIarg\fRs are supplied, the result is an empty string.
