.SH NAME
global \- Access global variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBglobal \fIvarname \fR?\fIvarname ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command is ignored unless a Tcl procedure is being interpreted.
If so then it declares the given \fIvarname\fR's to be global variables
rather than local ones.  For the duration of the current procedure
(and only while executing in the current procedure), any reference to
any of the \fIvarname\fRs will refer to the global variable by the same
name.

.SH KEYWORDS
global, procedure, variable
