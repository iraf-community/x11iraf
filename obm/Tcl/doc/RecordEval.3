.SH NAME
Tcl_RecordAndEval \- save command on history list before evaluating
.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR(\fIinterp, cmd, eval\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp;
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter in which to evaluate command.
.AP char *cmd in
Command (or sequence of commands) to execute.
.AP int eval in
0 means evaluate \fIcmd\fR, TCL_NO_EVAL means record it but don't

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR is invoked to record a command as an event
on the history list and then execute it.
It returns a completion code such as TCL_OK just like \fBTcl_Eval\fR
and it leaves information in \fIinterp->result\fR.
If you don't want the command recorded on the history list then
you should invoke \fBTcl_Eval\fR instead of \fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR.
Normally \fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR is only called with top-level
commands typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to
allow the user to re-issue recently-invoked commands.
If the \fIeval\fR argument is TCL_NO_EVAL then the command is
recorded without being evaluated.

.SH KEYWORDS
command, event, execute, history, interpreter, record
