.SH NAME
linsert \- Insert elements into a list
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBlinsert \fIlist index element \fR?\fIelement element ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command produces a new list from \fIlist\fR by inserting all
of the \fIelement\fR arguments just before the \fIindex\fRth
element of \fIlist\fR.  Each \fIelement\fR argument will become
a separate element of the new list.  If \fIindex\fR is less than
or equal to zero, then the new elements are inserted at the
beginning of the list.  If \fIindex\fR is greater than or equal
to the number of elements in the list, then the new elements are
appended to the list.

.SH KEYWORDS
element, insert, list
