.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The procedures described here are utilities for setting the
result/error string in a Tcl interpreter.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetResult\fR
arranges for \fIstring\fR to be the return string for the current Tcl
command in \fIinterp\fR, replacing any existing result.
If \fIfreeProc\fR is \fBTCL_STATIC\fR it means that \fIstring\fR
refers to an area of static storage that is guaranteed not to be
modified until at least the next call to \fBTcl_Eval\fR.
If \fIfreeProc\fR
is \fBTCL_DYNAMIC\fR it means that \fIstring\fR was allocated with a call
to \fBmalloc()\fR and is now the property of the Tcl system.
\fBTcl_SetResult\fR will arrange for the string's storage to be
released by calling \fBfree()\fR when it is no longer needed.
If \fIfreeProc\fR is \fBTCL_VOLATILE\fR it means that \fIstring\fR
points to an area of memory that is likely to be overwritten when
\fBTcl_SetResult\fR returns (e.g. it points to something in a stack frame).
In this case \fBTcl_SetResult\fR will make a copy of the string in
dynamically allocated storage and arrange for the copy to be the
return string for the current Tcl command.
.PP
If \fIfreeProc\fR isn't one of the values \fBTCL_STATIC\fR,
\fBTCL_DYNAMIC\fR, and \fBTCL_VOLATILE\fR, then it is the address
of a procedure that Tcl should call to free the string.
This allows applications to use non-standard storage allocators.
When Tcl no longer needs the storage for the string, it will
call \fIfreeProc\fR.  \fIFreeProc\fR should have arguments and
result that match the type \fBTcl_FreeProc\fR:
.nf
.RS

typedef void Tcl_FreeProc(char *\fIblockPtr\fR);

.RE
.fi
When \fIfreeProc\fR is called, its \fIblockPtr\fR will be set to
the value of \fIstring\fR passed to \fBTcl_SetResult\fR.
.PP
If \fIstring\fR is \fBNULL\fR, then \fIfreeProc\fR is ignored
and \fBTcl_SetResult\fR
re-initializes \fIinterp\fR's result to point to the pre-allocated result
area, with an empty string in the result area.
.PP
If \fBTcl_SetResult\fR is called at a time when \fIinterp\fR holds a
result, \fBTcl_SetResult\fR does whatever is necessary to dispose
of the old result (see the \fBTcl_Interp\fR manual entry for details
on this).
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendResult\fR makes it easy to build up Tcl results in pieces.
It takes each of its \fIstring\fR arguments and appends them in order
to the current result associated with \fIinterp\fR.
If the result is in its initialized empty state (e.g. a command procedure
was just invoked or \fBTcl_ResetResult\fR was just called),
then \fBTcl_AppendResult\fR sets the result to the concatenation of
its \fIstring\fR arguments.
\fBTcl_AppendResult\fR may be called repeatedly as additional pieces
of the result are produced.
\fBTcl_AppendResult\fR takes care of all the
storage management issues associated with managing \fIinterp\fR's
result, such as allocating a larger result area if necessary.
Any number of \fIstring\fR arguments may be passed in a single
call;  the last argument in the list must be a NULL pointer.
.PP
\fBTcl_AppendElement\fR is similar to \fBTcl_AppendResult\fR in
that it allows results to be built up in pieces.
However, \fBTcl_AppendElement\fR takes only a single \fIstring\fR
argument and it appends that argument to the current result
as a proper Tcl list element.
\fBTcl_AppendElement\fR adds backslashes or braces if necessary
to ensure that \fIinterp\fR's result can be parsed as a list and that
\fIstring\fR will be extracted as a single element.
Under normal conditions, \fBTcl_AppendElement\fR will add a space
character to \fIinterp\fR's result just before adding the new
list element, so that the list elements in the result are properly
separated.
.VS
However if the new list element is the first in a list or sub-list
(i.e. \fIinterp\fR's current result is empty, or consists of the
single character ``{'', or ends in the characters `` {'') then no
space is added.
.VE
.PP
\fBTcl_ResetResult\fR clears the result for \fIinterp\fR,
freeing the memory associated with it if the current result was
dynamically allocated.
It leaves the result in its normal initialized state with
\fIinterp->result\fR pointing to a static buffer containing
\fBTCL_RESULT_SIZE\fR characters, of which the first character
is zero.
\fBTcl_ResetResult\fR also clears the error state managed by
\fBTcl_AddErrorInfo\fR and \fBTcl_SetErrorCode\fR.
.PP
\fBTcl_FreeResult\fR is a macro that performs part of the work
of \fBTcl_ResetResult\fR.
It frees up the memory associated with \fIinterp\fR's result
and sets \fIinterp->freeProc\fR to zero, but it doesn't
change \fIinterp->result\fR or clear error state.
\fBTcl_FreeResult\fR is most commonly used when a procedure
is about to replace one result value with another.
