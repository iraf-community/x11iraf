.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Tcl allows a number of mathematical functions to be used in
expressions, such as \fBsin\fR, \fBcos\fR, and \fBhypot\fR.
\fBTcl_CreateMathFunc\fR allows applications to add additional functions
to those already provided by Tcl or to replace existing functions.
\fIName\fR is the name of the function as it will appear in expressions.
If \fIname\fR doesn't already exist as a function then a new function
is created.  If it does exist, then the existing function is replaced.
\fINumArgs\fR and \fIargTypes\fR describe the arguments to the function.
Each entry in the \fIargTypes\fR array must be either TCL_INT, TCL_DOUBLE,
or TCL_EITHER to indicate whether the corresponding argument must be an
integer, a double-precision floating value, or either, respectively.
.PP
Whenever the function is invoked in an expression Tcl will invoke
\fIproc\fR.  \fIProc\fR should have arguments and result that match
the type \fBTcl_MathProc\fR:
.nf
.RS
typedef int Tcl_MathProc(
.RS
ClientData \fIclientData\fR,
Tcl_Interp *\fIinterp\fR,
Tcl_Value *\fIargs\fR,
Tcl_Value *resultPtr\fR);
.RE
.RE
.fi
.PP
When \fIproc\fR is invoked the \fIclientData\fR and \fIinterp\fR
arguments will be the same as those passed to \fBTcl_CreateMathFunc\fR.
\fIArgs\fR will point to an array of \fInumArgs\fR Tcl_Value structures,
which describe the actual arguments to the function:
.nf
.RS
typedef struct Tcl_Value {
.RS
Tcl_ValueType \fItype\fR;
int \fIintValue\fR;
double \fIdoubleValue\fR;
.RE
} Tcl_Value;
.RE
.fi
.PP
The \fItype\fR field indicates the type of the argument and is
either TCL_INT or TCL_DOUBLE.
It will match the \fIargTypes\fR value specified for the function unless
the \fIargTypes\fR value was TCL_EITHER. Tcl converts
the argument supplied in the expression to the type requested in
\fIargTypes\fR, if that is necessary.
Depending on the value of the \fItype\fR field, the \fIintValue\fR
or \fIdoubleValue\fR field will contain the actual value of the argument.
.PP
\fIProc\fR should compute its result and store it either as an integer
in \fIresultPtr->intValue\fR or as a floating value in
\fIresultPtr->doubleValue\fR.
It should set also \fIresultPtr->type\fR to either TCL_INT or TCL_DOUBLE
to indicate which value was set.
Under normal circumstances \fIproc\fR should return TCL_OK.
If an error occurs while executing the function, \fIproc\fR should
return TCL_ERROR and leave an error message in \fIinterp->result\fR.
