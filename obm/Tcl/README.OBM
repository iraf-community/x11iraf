README for Tcl configured as part of the IRAF Object Manager Library.

This is the standard Tcl distribution; the only difference is the addition
of an Imakefile to allow automated building of the Tcl library as part of
the Object Manager.  The Imakefile should be machine independent with one
exception, the COMPAT_OBJS definition, which lists the compatibility
routines.  The list of objects defined here may have to be modified for
a different host.  One way to do this is to manually run "./configure" in
this directory to build the standard Tcl Makefile, then transfer the
COMPAT_OBJS entry therein to the Imakefile.

Tcl does not need to be installed (as in make install) to be used with the
Object Manager.  The contents of the Tcl library are automatically included
in libObm.a when the library is built.  The Tcl include file can be
referenced as Tcl/tcl.h, with the OBM root directory specified as an -I
include directory in the application's Imakefile.  In most cases the
application using OBM need not know that Tcl is used internally.
