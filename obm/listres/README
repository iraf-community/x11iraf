LISTRES -- This version of listres includes not only the standard Xt and Xaw
widgets, but also the Xaw3d widgets and any custom widgets included in ObmW.


Recipe for updating OBM to include new widget resources.

1. For each widget &:

    echo ""; echo &; listres -format "%s %s %s %s" &

2. Edit output and delete header lines.  Prepend the widget class name to
the start of each resources line for that widget, e.g.

    Panner Core height Height Dimension

3. Reorder the columns

    1,$s!\(.*\) \(.*\) \(.*\) \(.*\) \(.*\)!\3 \5 \1!

4. Sort

    1,$!sort | uniq

5. Reformat into form needed by obmres.c

    1,$s!\(.*\) \(.*\) \(.*\)! { "\1", "\2", \3 },!

6. Edit obmres.c to include new entries.  Sort resource list and edit class
codes as necessary.  These must agree with the definitions in ObmP.h.
