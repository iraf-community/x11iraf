Layout widget:

    fixed bug in laylex.l code - need to trim whitespace at end of a string
    token.

    this later turned out to be just a workaround for the real bug, which
    was an incorrect unput(c) macro.  the macro was not evaluating the (c)
    but the lex code involves side effects that assume that this is done.

    there was another bug in the Layout.c code.  the code that lays out
    the child widgets was using the size of a VariableBox to compute the
    child offsets, as if this were part of the geometry being laid out.


FWF widgets:

    icon.c code was modified to support new version of XPM
    pixmap files for builtin icons were edited and new icons were added
    modified Common.c to change algorithm which computes top/bottom shadows
    compute_inside modified in Common.c and Frame.c to avoid wrap to neg

Added sed script FWFSED which converts <Xfwf/foo.h> includes and deletes
#line references.

Group widget

    modified layout() to resize the child in the case where there is a single
    child widget (actually this was done in RowCol.c).

Layout widget

    modified debug output to print a header containing the widget name
