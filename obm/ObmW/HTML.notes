LOCAL REVISIONS
----------------------

Added a third argument (client_data for the callback function) to the
HTMLRetestAnchors function.  This required changes to several files.

Likewise, added a client_data argument to the pointer motion callback.
Mosaic in its callbacks would assume that the HTML widget was being called
from within Mosaic, but this doesn't work in a more general setting.

Modified the HTML widget to add a custom Realize method.  This calls the
realize method of the superclass and then makes a drawGC for the HTML
widget.  This was necessary to avoid segvios occuring when something is
drawn in the window before the application becomes idle and the widget
processes the first Expose event, as the widget would create the GC only
in response to the expose event.

Added a "scroll" action to the widget and modified the default HTML
translations to add u/d and j/k keys to permit vertical scrolling using the
keyboard instead of the scroll bars.
