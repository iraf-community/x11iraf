ObmW -- Custom widgets used by the Object Manager.  This directory contains
standalone X toolkit widgets; these are not tied to the Object Manager in any
way.  The widgets in this collection are included here if they are used in
the Object Manager but are not part of any standard toolkit.

To interface a new widget to the Object Manager, one can add the widget
source to this directory and modify ObmP.h and obmres.dat (which is generated
using obmres.c) in the OBM root directory to tell OBM about the widget and
its resources.  One may optionally wish to subclass the OBM Widget class to
make any widget-specific functions available to interpreted GUI code.

Notes on widget callbacks (used internally by OBM, not GUIs).
--------------------------------------------------------------

FWF widgets:

       Boolean XfwfMultiListGetItemInfo (mlw,item_index,str_ptr,h_ptr,s_ptr)
     Boolean XfwfMultiListHighlightItem (mlw,item_index)
     Boolean XfwfMultiListIsHighlighted (mlw,item_index)
   struct = XfwfMultiListGetHighlighted (mlw)
                XfwfMultiListSetNewData (mlw,list,nitems,longest,resize,
					 sensitivity_array)

            int XfwfMultiListToggleItem (mlw,item_index)
              XfwfMultiListHighlightAll (mlw)
            XfwfMultiListUnhighlightAll (mlw)
           XfwfMultiListUnhighlightItem (mlw,item_index)

			   XfwfGetThumb (self,info)
			  XfwfMoveThumb (self,x,y)
			XfwfResizeThumb (self,wd,ht)
		       XfwfSetScrollbar (self,pos,size)

       void XfwfConnectScrollingWidgets (w1, w2)


Athena widgets:

	  char* XawDialogGetValueString (w)
	                 XtFormDoLayout (w, do_layout)

		          XawListChange (w, list, nitems, longest, resize)
		       XawListHighlight (w, item)
		     XawListUnhighlight (w)
		     XawListShowCurrent (w)

		   XawScrollbarSetThumb (w, top, shown)

    Panner:	Callback when panner moves.
    Porthole:	Multiple children, only one managed at a time.  Single
		callback called when child is moved or resized.
    Repeater:	Repeating version of command widget.  Two callbacks, start
		callback and stop callback.
    Scrollbar:	Callbacks: jumpProc, scrollProc
    StripChart:	getValue callback called to get new data point
    Tree:	No special callbacks or functions
    Viewport:	Report callback called if child moved or resized

    All geometry widgets have a function to disable/force layout of the
    children, used to disable layout when multiple children are modified.
